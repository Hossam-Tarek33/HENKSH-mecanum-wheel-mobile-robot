# HENKSH---A-mecanum-wheel-mobile-robot!
HENKSH is a mobile robot based on four mecanum wheels. The robot uses Jetson-nano as a high-level layer where all the algorithms for navigation are applied. In the low-level layer, a Tiva tm4c123gxl is used for controlling the wheels and communicating with the Jetson.
